Students should use this rubric: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3072588797

for self-checking their submission.

In order to run the game, simply open the index page, and the game will commence on the canvas.
To win the game, the player must collect all three heart collectibles and then reach the safety of the ocean.
If the player does not have all three hearts, they will drown. If a bug catches the player or the player moves onto a space occupied by a bug, the player will be eaten.
Both of the above scenarios are tallied as losses, which will be counted as deaths in the tally that appears when the game ends.
If the player is not satisfied with their player sprite, they may refresh the page and hope the random selector works in their favor.
